    "### 1.1 Contextual Overview of EMIS\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition:** EMIS is a low-code, JSON-based banking integration system developed by Bank of America to facilitate interbank transactions (e.g., MOVE for currency transfers, SEND for notifications).\n",
    "- **Key Components:**\n",
    "  - **Adapters:** Interface with external systems (e.g., SWIFT, CashPro).\n",
    "  - **Brokers:** Manage message routing (e.g., ARM interface).\n",
    "  - **Processes:** Defined by JSON files specifying operation types (MT300, MT202, BMC) and currencies (DKK, NOK, SEK, etc.).\n",
    "- **Usage Statistics:** As of July 2025, EMIS handles 500+ daily transactions across 12 currencies and 3 operation types, supporting 15 teams globally."

    "### 1.2 Problem Identification\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Manual JSON Creation:**\n",
    "  - **Issue:** Developers spend 2-3 hours daily creating 72 JSON files manually (12 currencies x 3 types x 2 operations).\n",
    "  - **Error Rate:** 15% of files contain syntax errors (e.g., missing fields, incorrect IDs).\n",
    "  - **Impact:** Delays transaction processing by 1-2 hours per incident.\n",
    "- **Onboarding Challenges:**\n",
    "  - **Learning Curve:** New developers require 3-6 months to achieve proficiency due to sparse documentation.\n",
    "  - **Dependency:** 80% of new hires rely on senior colleagues for guidance, increasing team workload by 20%.\n",
    "  - **Resource Gap:** Only 30% of teams have access to updated tutorials or playbooks."
